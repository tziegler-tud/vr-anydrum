\section*{Signalanalyse}

We use simple highpass filtering to sort out most of the noise and only let stronger vibrations from the surface pass the sensors... 

To further smooth our data, we use boxfilter/ Gauss filter.

After basic filtering, we use ... to decide where the bang is coming from and what sound to play.

Instead of timbreID, which clusters and order features,we use ... \cite{timbreID}

DBSCAN is a density based cluster algorithm, which "cluster based on core and ...."
In contrary to .... algorithm, such as K-Means, it has the advantage to detect arbritrary forms of cluster and filter out noise\cite{Elbatta2013ADM}

In fact, that we have much noise in our velocity data, we decided to use DBSCAN, which is easy to implement. 
To further increase accuracy and the unknown fact of epsilon, we further used ARCADE, which is a ... to .... [cite]

Using 3 sensors, we had .... results, while 2 ... .and 1 was unsatisfacory.

For 3 sensors we used barycentric interpolation, for 2 linear interpolation, for one we approximated by time/force? 


Graph shows comparison between .... and the number of sensors used.
